## My Solution
My application is created using Boostrap, Jinja2 and Flask for the Front-End and Python and MySQL for the Back-End Development.It is a website where user's can organise a party and each time, random party theme, outfit colour, location and ticket price would be generated. Lucky winner can also have free entry ticket to the party. User's input is also taken into consideration as if a user is a child, the theme of the party generated would be suitable for children for example "Princess Party" where as for adults it would display different results for example "Halloween Parrty". The website is user-friendly and responsive for better user experience.

### Inital Trello Board
Initial Trello board has all the product backlog, sprint backlog which is then broken down into small and manageable tasks. Once each task is completed, it is then moved to Done and during that process if any errors were encountered, those were listed in bugs.

## 3. Risk Assessment
Risk Assessment was carried out to consider what could go wrong during the project and deciding on which control measures are to be taken in such situations. As a result, these control measures would help eliminate and reduce any risk involved during the project.

Below is the Risk Assessment displayed in the Table:
